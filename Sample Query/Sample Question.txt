Forecasting
Q15) Predict next month’s revenue.
Based on the available data, it is not possible to predict next month's revenue with certainty, as the dataset does not include historical revenue data or a clear pattern of revenue growth.

Business Recommendation: To predict next month's revenue, collect and analyze historical revenue data, including monthly transaction values and growth rates. Consider using time-series forecasting techniques, such as exponential smoothing or ARIMA models, to identify patterns and trends in the data. Additionally, factor in external influences, such as seasonality, market trends, and economic conditions, to refine the revenue forecast and make informed business decisions.
